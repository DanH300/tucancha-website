                    - Travelers from Ecuador who have access to live streams will need to subscribe for the live streams when they travel to other countries. N.B. Tucancha is free to viewers in Ecuador with subscription required outside of Ecuador.

                <p class="answer">
                    - The money of the user never gets deducted during his 7 day free trial. The way our 7-day trial program works is our merchant processor (Paypal) places an authorization to charge the credit card. When the user signs up and doesn't convert to the subscription
                    the merchant releases that authorization after the trial period is over. This means that there is no refund afterwards because the money is never deducted from the user.
